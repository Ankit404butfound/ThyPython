Suppose, there’s a sentence or word you don’t know the meaning of or don’t know how to pronounce it and you are too lazy to open a new tab in your browser for knowing the meaning of it,
Just copy the word to clipboard and press ‘/’ on keyboard and the program will give the translation in Hindi or any given language.
Or, if you want to know the pronunciation of the word, just press ‘`’ on the keyboard and it will speak it out.
